## Step 2: Create a Budget for Free Tier Hours
1. Go to the **Budgets** page in the **Billing Dashboard**.
2. Click **Create a budget**.
3. Select **Usage Budget**.
4. Set the following:
   - **Budget Name**: `FreeTierEC2Usage`
   - **Service**: `Amazon EC2`
   - **Usage Type**: `BoxUsage:t2.micro`
   - **Usage Limit**: `750 Hours`
5. Set up **Thresholds**:
   - Example: Alert at 50%, 75%, and 90% of 750 hours (375, 563, and 675 hours).
6. Configure **Notifications**:
   - Add email addresses where you want to receive alerts.

## Step 3: View Usage in CloudWatch (Optional)
1. Go to **CloudWatch** in the AWS Console.
2. Check **Billing Metrics**:
   - Metrics like `FreeTierUsage` may be available depending on your AWS region.
3. Create a CloudWatch Alarm:
   - Use the metric `EstimatedCharges` or similar to monitor your spending.

## Step 4: Automate Actions (Optional)
- To prevent overage, you can automate EC2 instance shutdown using AWS Lambda:
   - **Create a Lambda Function**: Stop EC2 instances when the 750-hour limit is approached.
   - **Use EventBridge**: Trigger the Lambda function based on the budget alerts.

This setup will notify you when you are near the free tier limit, helping you avoid unexpected charges.
